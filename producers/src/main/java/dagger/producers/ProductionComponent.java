/**
 * Annotates an interface or abstract class for which a fully-formed, dependency-injected
 * implementation is to be generated from a set of {@linkplain #modules}. The generated class will
 * have the name of the type annotated with {@code @ProductionComponent} prepended with
 * {@code Dagger_}.  For example, {@code @ProductionComponent interface MyComponent {...}} will
 * produce an implementation named {@code Dagger_MyComponent}.
 *
 * <p>Each {@link Produces} method that contributes to the component will be called at most once per
 * component instance, no matter how many times that binding is used as a dependency.
 * TODO(user): Decide on how scope works for producers.
 *
 * <h2>Component methods</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every type annotated with {@code @ProductionComponent} must contain at least one abstract
 * component method. Component methods must represent {@linkplain Producer production}.
 *
 * Production methods have no arguments and return either a {@link ListenableFuture} or
 * {@link Producer} of a type that is {@link Inject injected}, {@link Provides provided}, or
 * {@link Produces produced}. Each may have a {@link Qualifier} annotation as well. The following
 * are all valid production method declarations: <pre>   {@code
 *
 *   ListenableFuture<SomeType> getSomeType();
 *   Producer<Set<SomeType>> getSomeTypes();
 *   @Response ListenableFuture<Html> getResponse();}</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Exceptions</h2>
 *
 * <p>When a producer throws an exception, the exception will be propagated to its downstream
 * producers in the following way: if the downstream producer injects a type {@code T}, then that
 * downstream producer will be skipped, and the exception propagated to its downstream producers;
 * and if the downstream producer injects a {@code Produced<T>}, then the downstream producer will
 * be run with the exception stored in the {@code Produced<T>}.
 *
 * <p>If a non-execution exception is thrown (e.g., an {@code InterruptedException} or
 * {@code CancellationException}), then exception is handled as in
 * {@link com.google.common.util.concurrent.Futures#transform}.
 * TODO(user): Explain this more thoroughly, and possibly update the javadocs of those utilities.
