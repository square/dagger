/**
 * Annotates an interface or abstract class for which a fully-formed, dependency-injected
 * implementation is to be generated from a set of {@linkplain #modules}. The generated class will
 * have the name of the type annotated with {@code @Component} prepended with
 * {@code DaggerComponent_}.  For example, {@code @Component interface MyComponent {...}} will
 * produce an implementation named {@code DaggerComponent_MyComponent}.
 *
 * <h2>Component methods</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every type annotated with {@code @Component} must contain at least one abstract component
 * method. Component methods must either represent {@linkplain Provider provision} or
 * {@linkplain MembersInjector member injection}.
 *
 * Provision methods have no arguments and return an {@link Inject injected} or
 * {@link Provides provided} type.  Each may have a {@link Qualifier} annotation as well. The
 * following are all valid provision method declarations: <pre>   {@code
 *   SomeType getSomeType();
 *   Set<SomeType> getSomeTypes();
 *   @PortNumber int getPortNumber();
 *   }</pre>
 *
 * Member injection methods take a single parameter and optionally return that same type. The
 * following are all valid member injection method declarations: <pre>   {@code
 *   void injectSomeType(SomeType someType);
 *   SomeType injectAndReturnSomeType(SomeType someType);
 *   }</pre>
