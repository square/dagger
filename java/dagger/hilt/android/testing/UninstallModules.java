/**
 * An annotation used to uninstall modules that have previously been installed with {@link
 * dagger.hilt.InstallIn}.
 *
 * <p>This feature should only be used in tests. It is useful for replacing production bindings with
 * fake bindings. The basic idea is to allow users to uninstall the module that provided the
 * production binding so that a fake binding can be provided by the test.
 *
 * <p>Example:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 *   {@literal @}UninstallModules({
 *       ProdFooModule.class,
 *   })
 *   {@literal @}GenerateComponents
 *   {@literal @}HiltAndroidTest
 *   public class MyTest {
 *     {@literal @}Module
 *     {@literal @}InstallIn(ApplicationComponent.class)
 *     interface FakeFooModule {
 *       {@literal @}Binds Foo bindFoo(FakeFoo fakeFoo);
 *     }
 *   }
 * </code></pre>
