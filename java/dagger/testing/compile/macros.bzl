def compiler_test(name, size = "large", compiler_deps = None, **kwargs):
    """Generates a java_test that tests java compilation with the given compiler deps.

    This macro separates the compiler dependencies from the test dependencies to avoid
    1-version violations. For example, this often happens when the java_test uses java
    dependencies but the compiler test expects the android version of the dependencies.

    Args:
      name: The name of the java_test.
      size: The size of the test (default "large" since this test does disk I/O).
      compiler_deps: The deps needed during compilation.
      **kwargs: The parameters to pass to the generated java_test.

    Returns:
      None
