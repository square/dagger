A fast dependency injector for Android and Java.

--------

You will need to include the `dagger-${dagger.version}.jar` in your
application's runtime.  In order to activate code generation you will need to
include `dagger-compiler-${dagger.version}.jar` in your build at compile time.

In a Maven project, one would include the runtime in the dependencies section
of your `pom.xml` (replacing `${dagger.version}` with the appropriate current
release), and the `dagger-compiler` artifact as an "optional" or "provided"
dependency:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.squareup.dagger</groupId>
    <artifactId>dagger</artifactId>
    <version>${dagger.version}</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.squareup.dagger</groupId>
    <artifactId>dagger-compiler</artifactId>
    <version>${dagger.version}</version>
    <optional>true</optional>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

You can include Dagger in your Android gradle projects with the following:

```gradle
dependencies {
  compile 'com.squareup.dagger:dagger:${dagger.version}'
  provided 'com.squareup.dagger:dagger-compiler:${dagger.version}'
}
```

You can also find downloadable .jars on Maven Central. You'll need
[Dagger][dl-dagger], [JavaWriter][dl-javawriter], and [javax.inject][dl-inject].
