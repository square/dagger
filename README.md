# Dagger

[![Maven Central][mavenbadge-svg]][mavencentral]

A fast dependency injector for Java and Android.

Dagger is a compile-time framework for dependency injection. It uses no
reflection or runtime bytecode generation, does all its analysis at
compile-time, and generates plain Java source code.

Dagger is actively maintained by the same team that works on [Guava]. Snapshot
releases are auto-deployed to Sonatype's central Maven repository on every clean
build with the version `HEAD-SNAPSHOT`. The current version builds upon previous
work done at [Square][square].

## Documentation

You can [find the dagger documentation here][website] which has extended usage
instructions and other useful information. More detailed information can be
found in the [API documentation][latestapi].

You can also learn more from [the original proposal][proposal],
[this talk by Greg Kick][gaktalk], and on the dagger-discuss@googlegroups.com
mailing list.

## Installation

### Bazel

If you build with `bazel`, you will need to configure your top-level workspace
to access Dagger/Hilt targets that export the proper dependencies and plugins.

First, import the Dagger repository into your `WORKSPACE` file using
[`http_archive`][bazel-external-deps], load the `DAGGER_ARTIFACTS` and
`DAGGER_REPOSITORIES`, and add them to your list of [`maven_install`] artifacts.

Note: The `http_archive` must point to a tagged release of Dagger, not just any
commit. The version of the Dagger artifacts will match the version of the tagged
release.

```python
# Top-level WORKSPACE file

http_archive(
    name = "dagger",
    urls = ["https://github.com/google/dagger/archive/dagger-<version>.zip"],
)

load("@dagger//:workspace_defs.bzl", "DAGGER_ARTIFACTS", "DAGGER_REPOSITORIES")

maven_install(
    artifacts = DAGGER_ARTIFACTS + [...],
    repositories = DAGGER_REPOSITORIES + [...],
)
```

Next, load and call `dagger_rules` in your top-level `BUILD` file:

```python
# Top-level BUILD file

load("@dagger//:workspace_defs.bzl", "dagger_rules")

dagger_rules()
```

This will setup Dagger and Hilt build targets of the form `:<artifact_id>`.
(Note that these targets already export all of the dependencies and processors
they need).

```python
deps = [
    ":dagger",                  # For Dagger
    ":dagger-spi",              # For Dagger SPI
    ":dagger-producers",        # For Dagger Producers
    ":dagger-android",          # For Dagger Android
    ":dagger-android-support",  # For Dagger Android (Support)
    ":hilt-android",            # For Hilt Android
    ":hilt-android-testing",    # For Hilt Android Testing
]
```

### Other build systems

You will need to include the `dagger-2.x.jar` in your application's runtime.
In order to activate code generation and generate implementations to manage
your graph you will need to include `dagger-compiler-2.x.jar` in your build
at compile time.

#### Maven

In a Maven project, include the `dagger` artifact in the dependencies section
of your `pom.xml` and the `dagger-compiler` artifact as an
`annotationProcessorPaths` value of the `maven-compiler-plugin`:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.dagger</groupId>
    <artifactId>dagger</artifactId>
    <version>2.x</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>3.6.1</version>
      <configuration>
        <annotationProcessorPaths>
          <path>
            <groupId>com.google.dagger</groupId>
            <artifactId>dagger-compiler</artifactId>
            <version>2.x</version>
          </path>
        </annotationProcessorPaths>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```

If you are using a version of the `maven-compiler-plugin` lower than `3.5`, add
the `dagger-compiler` artifact with the `provided` scope:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.dagger</groupId>
    <artifactId>dagger</artifactId>
    <version>2.x</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.dagger</groupId>
    <artifactId>dagger-compiler</artifactId>
    <version>2.x</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

If you use the beta `dagger-producers` extension (which supplies
parallelizable execution graphs), then add this to your maven configuration:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.dagger</groupId>
    <artifactId>dagger-producers</artifactId>
    <version>2.x</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

#### Gradle
```groovy
// Add Dagger dependencies
dependencies {
  api 'com.google.dagger:dagger:2.x'
  annotationProcessor 'com.google.dagger:dagger-compiler:2.x'
}
```

If you're using classes in `dagger.android` you'll also want to include:

```groovy
api 'com.google.dagger:dagger-android:2.x'
api 'com.google.dagger:dagger-android-support:2.x' // if you use the support libraries
annotationProcessor 'com.google.dagger:dagger-android-processor:2.x'
```

Notes:

-   Some projects will want to use `implementation` instead of `api` for better
    compilation performance.
    -   See the [Gradle documentation][gradle-api-implementation] for more
        information on how to select appropriately, and the [Android Gradle
        plugin documentation][gradle-api-implementation-android] for Android
        projects.
-   For Kotlin projects, use [`kapt`] in place of `annotationProcessor`.

If you're using the [Android Databinding library][databinding], you may want to
increase the number of errors that `javac` will print. When Dagger prints an
error, databinding compilation will halt and sometimes print more than 100
errors, which is the default amount for `javac`. For more information, see
[Issue 306](https://github.com/google/dagger/issues/306).

```groovy
gradle.projectsEvaluated {
  tasks.withType(JavaCompile) {
    options.compilerArgs << "-Xmaxerrs" << "500" // or whatever number you want
  }
}
```

*   [Documentation][website]
*   [Javadocs][latestapi]
*   [GitHub Issues]


If you do not use maven, gradle, ivy, or other build systems that consume
maven-style binary artifacts, they can be downloaded directly via the
[Maven Central Repository][mavencentral].

Developer snapshots are available from Sonatype's
[snapshot repository][dagger-snap], and are built on a clean build of
the GitHub project's master branch.
