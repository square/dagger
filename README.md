A fast dependency injector for Android and Java.

Download
--------

You will need to include the `dagger-${dagger.version}.jar` in your
application's runtime.  In order to activate code generation you will need to
include `dagger-compiler-${dagger.version}.jar` in your build at compile time.

In a Maven project, one would include the runtime in the dependencies section
of your `pom.xml` (replacing `${dagger.version}` with the appropriate current
release), and the `dagger-compiler` artifact as an "optional" dependency:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.squareup</groupId>
    <artifactId>dagger</artifactId>
    <version>${dagger.version}</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.squareup</groupId>
    <artifactId>dagger-compiler</artifactId>
    <version>${dagger.version}</version>
    <optional>true</optional>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

You can also find downloadable .jars on the [GitHub download page][2].
